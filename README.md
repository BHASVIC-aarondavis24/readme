My name is Aaron Davis, I'm studying computer science, photography, and creative digital media production at BHASVIC. My goal is to be successful in my career, hoping to be self employed for more freedom and financial oppurtunity. I've had work experience at aviva and Creative Technologies. At AVIVA is was shown the entire department of cyber security there throughout the week, from red team to shadowing the head of the department I learnt alot through what they do there, aswell as attending the meetings and a speech from the CEO of AVIVA. At creative technologies, I had hands on work at each department, setting up ger for events such as Glastonbury and Dua Lipa's Tour. This was more working as if I had the job rather than just learning about the departments so it was a good pratical experience. I've had experiences on films such as helping on the production of Strike (2018) and partaking as an actor in Caught (2017). These experiences have helped me build connections and experiences in the real world which will benefit me in the future. I am currently studying Java and can confidently code standard programs with it. I will be using greenfoot for my pprogramming project, utilising it to create a dungeon crawler video game.
